/**
 * This menu class creates objects for BookYourShow and Show objects
 * and adds the shows objects to the BookYourShow Object. Then the
 * Patrons can book the tickets based on the shows available.
 *
 * This is a sample and skeleton code that gives you an idea of how
 * to create objects for different classes.
 *
 * You can have your own test cases and test your Show, Patron and
 * BookYourShow classes.
